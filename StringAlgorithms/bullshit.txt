The noor Walrus and The Carpenter noor (Lewis Carroll)







>From "Through noor the Looking-Glass and What noor Alice Found There" [1872]
The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make noor
The billows smooth and bright-- noor
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
